We've included a load balancers which plays a crucial role in optimizing system performance, scalability, availability, and\
resource utilization in distributed computing environments.

Given the size of the network and the limited number of servers, the algorithm is selected to promote simplicity and fairness.\
Therefore, the Round Robin is used since it evenly distributes requests across the available servers, ensuring\
each server gets a fair share of the workload. Also, it's easy to implement and doesn't require complex monitoring or calculations.

Active-Passive setup is used since it provides failover protection and better resource utilization when the passive server(s) are not\
actively handling traffic.

A Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) database cluster works as follows:
1. The Primary database serves as the authoritative source for read and write operations.
2. Replica databases (Slaves) are read-only copies of the Primary database.
3. The Primary continuously logs changes in a replication log.
4. Replicas periodically retrieve and apply these logs to synchronize their data with the Primary.
5. Replicas serve for scaling read operations, fault tolerance, and data backups.
6. Replication lag may occur due to delays in applying changes to replicas.
7. In the event of Primary failure, a replica can be promoted to become the new Primary through failover.
8. Failover ensures high availability and allows the failed Primary to rejoin the cluster as a replica.

The primary node is responsible for handling read and write operations as the main point of contact for client requests while the Replica\
nodes serve as copies of the primary node and are primarily used for backup, fault tolerance, and load balancing purposes.

The network has security issues given there's no firewall and the HTTPS protocol is not being used. Also, there is no monitoring.
