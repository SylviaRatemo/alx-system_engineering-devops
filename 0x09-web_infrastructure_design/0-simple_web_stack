Part A
1. A server is a computer or system that provides resources, services, or functionality to other computers or devices,\
known as clients, over a network. It is designed to handle and respond to requests from clients,\
enabling them to access and utilize its resources or services.
2. The domain name serves as a human-readable and memorable identifier for websites and other internet resources. 
3. the "www" subdomain is usually represented by a DNS CNAME (Canonical Name) record or an A (Address) record.
4. The web server plays a crucial role in delivering web content and facilitating communication between clients (web browsers)\
and web applications.
5. The role of an application server is to host, manage, and execute applications or software components
6. The role of a database is to store, manage, and organize structured data in a manner that allows for efficient storage,\
retrieval, and manipulation of information. 
7. When a user requests a website, the server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol.

Part B
1. An issue with the network is that it has a Single Point of Failure (SPOF).
It means for a component or part of a system that, if it fails, will cause the entire system to fail or significantly degrade its\
performance. In other words, a single point of failure is a vulnerability that, when compromised, can disrupt the normal functioning\
of a system.
2. Also, downtime is unavoidable when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
3. Finally, the network cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
